# Cybersecurity Portfolio - LT Celine Tannous

## 🎯 Overview

Welcome to my cybersecurity portfolio. I am a U.S. Navy Nuclear Surface Warfare Officer and former Cyber Officer (USS Harper’s Ferry) transitioning into the private sector as a Cybersecurity Analyst. I hold a B.S. in Cyber Operations from a CAE-CO accredited university and a CompTIA Security+ certification. My operational background, technical foundation, and leadership experience enable me to approach cybersecurity with discipline, problem-solving, and mission focus.

This portfolio demonstrates my hands-on cybersecurity skills through self-directed projects in vulnerability management, SIEM operations, incident response, network analysis, system hardening, and adversary emulation. All projects were built using my home lab environment (Windows, Linux, Splunk, Nessus, Wireshark, and Atomic Red Team).
