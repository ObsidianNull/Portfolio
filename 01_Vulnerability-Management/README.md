# Vulnerability Management Project (Nessus Essentials)

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates my capability to perform vulnerability scanning, interpret results, and develop a remediation plan using Nessus Essentials within a home lab environment.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Configure Nessus and scan internal hosts  
- Identify and categorize vulnerabilities  
- Prioritize based on CVSS and exploitability  
- Develop a remediation plan  
- Validate fixes through a follow-up scan  

## 🧰 Tools Used
- Nessus Essentials  
- Windows 10 VM  
- Ubuntu Server VM  
- PowerShell / Bash  
- CVSS Calculator

## 📝 Methodology
1. **Host preparation** – Deployed Windows 10 and Ubuntu VMs.  
2. **Scan configuration** – Configured basic and credentialed scans.  
3. **Execution** – Ran full system scans.  
4. **Analysis** – Categorized findings by severity and exploitability.  
5. **Remediation** – Applied patches, disabled insecure services, and updated packages.  
6. **Re-Scan** – Validated fixes and compared results.
