# Purple Team Exercises – Atomic Red Team

## 📌 Overview
This project simulates attacker behaviors using Atomic Red Team and develops corresponding detection logic.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Execute MITRE ATT&CK techniques  
- Observe system and network effects  
- Build detection logic in Splunk  
- Document results  

---

## 🧰 Tools Used
- Atomic Red Team  
- Windows 10  
- Sysmon  
- Splunk  

---

## 🧪 Techniques Simulated
- **T1059.001** – PowerShell execution  
- **T1047** – WMI execution  

Each technique folder includes:
- Execution results  
- Detection logic  
- Screenshots  

---

## 📚 Lessons Learned
- Adversary emulation reveals log coverage gaps  
- Detection rules must be tuned for noise reduction
